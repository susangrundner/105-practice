					<p>Don't stress yourself out when your code isnt exactly like someone else's. There are so many ways to style things through CSS that there is obviously more than one way to reach the same outcome as someone else. Just like in how we all have different voices when we write, its the same when it comes to code.</p>

					<p>More times than not youre going to find yourself scowering your stylesheets and html to find why specific things wont work, and more often than not the cleanliness and neatness of your code will help you find those pesky little bugs and errors.</p>

					<p>Just like how your code wont always be the same as someone elses, neither is your thrist for your own creative style. Dont be afraid to try new things. There are a billion different ways to style and you should tackle your CSS to find your own little personal niche in those billion different combinations.</p>
