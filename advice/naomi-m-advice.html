              <h4>Mistakes are your friends!</h4>
              <p>It's the same as in life, you learn from your mistakes. I feel like this is an even truer statement when learning to code. Those times when something goes wrong and really fustrates you but then you figure out the solution are THE most satisfying. They will also be the snippets of code or processes you remember the easiest. </p>
            </div>

              <div class="container-two">
                <h4>Practice, practice... and more practice!</h4>
                <p>You can read over something all you like, until you type that code yourself you will not really to get grips with it yourself. Own your craft by being brave and trying new code out, don't be scared of going wrong, that is how you improve.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="container-three">
                <h4>Is coding for you? There's so many others more advanced!</h4>
                <p>Imposter syndrome is REAL my friend, expect to feel it, but remember no one was born a coder!</p>
