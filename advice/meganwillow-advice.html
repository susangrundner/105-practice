                <h4>Patience is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, and a new opportunity.</p>
 
                <p>Patience, therefore, is going to be very helpful. Patience, not only with the process but also patience with yourself while you take on this challenge.</p>
 
                <h4>Help is available when needed.</h4>
                <p> Remember that this is a totally new process for you. It is ok to ask for help if you need it.</p>
                
                <h4>Go at your own pace.</h4>
            <div class="final-p">
                <p>Do not rush through your courses. Slow down and make sure you fully understand the course material before moving on.</p>
