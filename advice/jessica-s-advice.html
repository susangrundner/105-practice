                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>
 
                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>
 
                <h4>Use the Slack community for help.</h4>
                <p>Fellow students and instructors are super friendly and answer questions fairly quickly. Don't feel like you have to figure everything out by yourself!</p>

                <h4>Just keep swimming!</h4>
                <p> Or keep moving forward in the lessons. What you're doing may not make any sense, but it will as you keep moving forward.</p>
