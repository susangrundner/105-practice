                <h4>In the words of Yoda: <span><em>Try not! Do or do not. There is no try.</em></span></h4>
                <p>Don't try to code.  Just open your editor and do it. The more you do, the more you learn.</p>

                <h4>And...as I tell my kids....It's only hard until you <strong> understand it</strong></h4>
                <p>Don't let yourself become intimidated by what you don't already understand. Try it one way. If you still don't understand it, try different ways until you do. There's more than one way to peel a banana!</p>
