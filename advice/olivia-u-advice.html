                <h2>Make coding fun and pretend you're at Hogwarts!</h2>
				<p>Be excited to learn new things. You are officially out of the cupboard under the stairs. You've stepped foot in Hogwarts and things will never be the same now. You may be a lowly first year, but now you know there's more to life than the muggle world. There are endless classes to take, books to read, and topics to explore waiting for you! How exciting! Enjoy the magic. And enjoy the magic of learning and creating new things.
