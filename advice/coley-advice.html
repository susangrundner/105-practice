                <h3>Confusion is a-okay!</h3>
                <p>The first time I'm introduced to something new, I let it go over my head. I used to stress out and try to retain all kinds of details that then wouldn't sink in until the third or fourth time I heard them. The stress didn't help and resulted in frustration. Don't let it! Sit back, absorb what you can, and then start practicing!</p>

                <h3>You're great exactly where you are.</h3>
                <p>We're all learning. Everyone starts as a beginner. When working with my back-end developers, I get overwhelmed by their depth of knowledge as compared to my inch-deep understanding. Then I remind myself that they've been doing this for a long time. It's all good! I'll keep learning and I'll get better! In the meantime, I'm doing great being where I am.</p>
