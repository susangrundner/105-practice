				<h1>Hi, my name is Rob and I have advice for you...</h1>

				<!-- I started to code on a Commodore Vic 20 and an Apple IIe.  As much as I enjoyed writing Basic language, I didn't continue on with coding as a career until now. 17 years ago, I began writing html and building web pages and knew I needed to pursue coding as my career.  Now I'm ready to make it official with Skillcrush- just like you! -->
