                <h4>It's a marathon, not a sprint!</h4>

                <p>Try and take things slowly at first. You want to be able to spend as much time as possible practising a certain skill before you move onto the next one.</p>

                <p>For example, I have found learning Git very challenging, so I will be sepnding the next week or so going over the same concepts to make sure I have a good understanding of them before I move on.</p>

                <h4>Get involved with Slack!</h4>

                <p> The coding community is huge. Why let that easy-to-reach resource go to waste? Slack is great because it is full of students working on the same things as you are!</p>

                <p>Make sure you ask somebody for help if you are ever stuck or unsure about something. We're all here to help and most of us love a good challange!</p>

                <h4>Don't forget your cheatsheets!</h4>

                <p>Nobody is expecting you to remeber all that code. Make sure you utilise the cheatsheets as much as possible - after all, it's not actually cheating! </p>

                <p>Remembering certain bits of code will come with experience, time and practice. So what are you wating for? <span>Get going!</span></p>
