                <h4>Encourage Yourself</h4>
                <p>Feeling discouraged in your learning process? Be kind to yourself. Positive mindset and self-compassion are correlated with better learning outcomes. Speak kindly to yourself, give yourself the benefit of the doubt, and celebrate your accomplishments.</p>
                <h4>Take Breaks</h4>
                <p>Science suggests that cramming actually decreases long-term learning. It's time to take a break after you've studied for about 30-50 minutes. This allows your brain to process and integrate the new information.   </p>
                <h4>See the Humor</h4>
                <p>Humor dispels stress and anxiety and brings joy to the learning process. Students who learn in a joyful environment retain more learning and are more engaged. Get your dopamine flowing and reduce activation of your amygdala with positive humor.</p>
