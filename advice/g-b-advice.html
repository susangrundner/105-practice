                    <h4>Keep At It</h4>
                    <p>It sometimes takes a bit for big concepts and nitty gritty details to set in. Just keep powering through and make sure to try to solve your problems. This will build your "dev muscles" for future challenges!</p>

                    <h4>Get Your Hands Dirty</h4>
                    <p>The best way to get your learning to stick is to put it to work on projects! I recommend doing projects as soon as possible. Project work will force you to think more creatively than the prompts and lessons- just like the real world! </p>
