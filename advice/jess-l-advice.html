                <h4>This can be challenging but you have this!</h4>
                <p>I decided to start programming because I wanted a challenge, among other things. This is definitely a challenge but in a good way, I know I can achive my goals but if I do get stuck I always have a support network to help me. </p>

                <p>Without a challenge are you able to grow? I don't think so. Skillcrush gave me the knowledge to overcome my challenges when programming and I'm very grateful for that.</p>

                <h4>You are learning an new language.</h4>
                <p>When you start programming you are learning a new language and this can be a little overwhelming. However you have to remember that with all new challenges come new rewards so solder-on and I guarantee it will get easier.</p>

                <p>The more you commit yourself and practice, practice, practice the easier it gets but some times road blocks happen but I know you can figure out a way to get around them.</p>

                <p>So take the plunge and start now and have faith in yourself because you have this.</p>
