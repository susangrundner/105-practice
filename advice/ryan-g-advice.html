                <h4>Don't try to learn too much at once!</h4>
                <p>Learning new things can be exciting.  But don't try to blast through an entire course in one sitting.  Give yourself an opportunity to practice a new idea before you move on to something new.</p>

                <p>Take breaks.  Learn in small chunks.  Put things into practice on your own.  Don't do too much in one day.</p>

              <div class="disbelief">
                <h4>Find time to meditate!</h4>
                <p>This has nothing to do with coding.  It's just good advice.</p>

                <p>Give yourself 10 minutes every day to find some stillness.  Your mind will thank you.</p>
