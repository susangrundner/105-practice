                <h4>The journey of learning</h4>
                <p>Before I looked at a career in Tech I’d had a career in food.</p>
                <p>In my experience, learning to really cook well begins as 95% disappointment and 5% success.</p>
                <p>As you improve these percentages shift more in your favour as you get better at averting disaster, but the ratios don’t change too much. Learning to cope with these crushing disappointments comes with the wisdom that you are actually moving along a continuum of progress and learning. There is no failure, just observations, experience, knowledge and skill developments along a timeline. You will continue to try new things, feel out of your depth, struggle then eventually overcome and then begin the endless meander towards the goal of perfection. It never ends, so it’s important to remember that most of the fun is actually the challenge and the journey of discovering new things.</p>

            <div class="advice">
                <h4>Just 5 minutes</h4>
                <p>My only other advice that I’ve learnt from coaching training is the 5 minute rule.</p>
                <p>
                If you want to achieve something there will be days when you feel you should take an action but there’s the looming urge to procrastinate.<br> When you feel that temptation, just do 5 minutes, that’s all. <br>
                No pressure to do more. It can simply be planning what you’ll do tomorrow, setting up your desk, or just reading the title of tomorrow's tasks. Everyone has 5 minutes. <br>
                You’ll often do more but the freedom of the 5 minute rule means you don’t have to without feeling guilty!.</p>
