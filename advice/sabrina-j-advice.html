                <h2>Don't "suffer" in silence...Reach out for help!</h2>
                <p>Learning a new skill is rarely easy! One minute your flying, taking in all this new information ..no problem! Then BAM ...you hit the stumbling block..oh god...I just don't get it. <br /> Don't panic! We've all been there! The most important things to remember are where you can get help.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li> First, remember to reach out to the Skillcrush coaches, or the community through Slack..theres a good chance its a problem someone has encounted before, and can help you out!</li>
                  <li> Secondly, Get familiar with external resources....have a bunch of handy websites on your bookmarks..such as <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank"> W3 Schools </a> , <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank"> Mark up validation websites</a> for checking that code, and get real good at asking google the right questions..there are a tonne of forums out there..and again someone else is likely to have encounted and solved this problem before...get good at being resourceful..we live in the information age..use this to your advantage!</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Practice, Practice, Practice.</h2>
                <p>We've all heard the saying practice makes perfect.. well some very clever psychologists did some research into how the brain actually learns and retains new skills, and what it takes for what they call "automaticity" or in other words, learning to do something so well you can do it unconsciously!</p>
                <p>So what does it take to make coding as easy as breathing I hear you cry....well it simply takes over-learning and overtraining..<br />Think back to when you were learning to drive....to begin with you had to consciously think about every single thing you did, but then the more you drove the easier it became...until eventually you drive without really giving it much thought, your merrily driving along singing away to your favourite track, and even sometimes can't actually remember how you even got from A - B. <br />So whats my point.....well I guess this is what I am trying to say...</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Learing something new feels uncomfortable to begin with....so if this is all feeling completely alien and uncomfortable....REJOICE...your on the path to great new things...Dig deep and keep going. <br /> "Success is on the other side of your comfort zone" <span>Orrin Woodward.</span></li>
                    <li>When you start to feel comfortable with your new skill...push yourself again...find another aspect of that skill that challenges you...think of it like weight training, when lifting 10k is easy you dont do more reps, you increase the weight. Learning a new skill is the same, make it progressivly more challenging to stay on your A game!</li>

                <h2>The most important thing to remember...Above all else....</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>You are amazing.</li>
                  <li>You can achieve anything.</li>
                  <li>Great things take time, be patient. It doesn't matter how slowly you go, just don't stop.</li>
                  <li>Never stop reflecting, and when times get hard, don't focus on how far you have to go, look back at how far you have come.</li>
