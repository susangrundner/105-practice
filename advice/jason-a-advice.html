                <h4>Keep your eyes on the big picture!</h4>
                <p>When classes that are abstract and difficult to learn like Git comes into view, it's easy to lose heart. I felt discouraged too but something that really help me push forward was to keep thinking about my goals and how I want to become a professional too!</p>
 
                <h4>Power through it! You got this!</h4>
                <p>Keep it going and keep it going everyday! Don't let yourself lose momentum! Let that momentum work for you! You want to embark on a new journey and now is the time so just keep at it!</p>
