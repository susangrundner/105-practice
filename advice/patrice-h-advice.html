                <h4>Keep Going</h4>
                <p>It’s easy to get frustrated. Let yourself keep going. Let yourself make mistakes and push forward even though you don't know everything. Let go of perfectionism at least in the begining.  With practice, you'll discover some amazing things. </p>

                <p>You will get frustrated, you will run into concepts that take some time to comprehend, but you will get it.  Keep working it. If you’re completely stuck and  frustrated, do something else. Get up and get a glass of water, walk, get outside. Do something with your body, then get back to it.  If you haven’t come up with a solution you can reach out to the extremely large and helpful community of coders.</p>

                <h4>Ask</h4>
                <p>If you’re stuck or need to understand something better there are thousands of helpful people out there who want to see you succeed. This community is giving and incredibly intelligent. Reaching out can be one of the most valuable things you do as a new coder.  When you are ready (really before you’re ready) be available to someone newer than you. Be there to assure them that they are on the right track and they just need to keep going.</p>
