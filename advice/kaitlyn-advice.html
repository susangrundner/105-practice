                <h2>Make Connections!</h2>
                <p>The more ways you can connect things you're learning to things you already know, the better you'll understand and remember them.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reading your knitting patterns like they're code</li>
                    <li>Use naming consistent naming conventions to organize your computer</li>
                    <li>Think of finding errors in your code like playing your favorite hidden objects game.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Try It Again</h2>
                <p>Repetition is key. Even better is doing it over in a different place or a different way. Strengthen those neural pathways by varying your practice.</p>
                <h2>Take a Break</h2>
                <p>Most importantly remember that your brain needs time to store new information and taking a break is often the best way to solve your most difficult problems. </p>
