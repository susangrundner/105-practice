        <h4>Make Mistakes!</h4>
        <p>
          Making mistakes is a part of learning. Everyone says that, but it's
          because it's true! My biggest learning moments came from making
          mistakes and figuring out why things didn't work the way I thought
          they should.
        </p>
        <h4>Push Through!</h4>
        <p>
          It feels bad to suck at something, or to not "get it" as fast as you
          think you should. Keep pushing through that discomfort and it will
          eventually click for you. Keep trying, push through the frustration.
          You will get this!
        </p>
        <h4>Ask Yourself...</h4>
        <p>
          Pretend you're talking with someone who could help you, like a
          Skillcrush instructor or other student. Go through the process as if
          you would be explaining it to them. You might just figure the problem
          out yourself by talking it through out loud.
