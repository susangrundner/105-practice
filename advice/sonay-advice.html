            <h3>Confusion is real, but don't let it defeat nor detour you</h3>
            <p>You are learning a brand spanking new skill and like everything else it is confusing and can even be a little scary. The best part of learning programing, is the answer is out there, somewhere. Remember all of your disposable resources and
                when in doubt Google, Google, Google.</p>
            <h3>Confusion is your friend!</h3>
            <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this
                THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening </p>
            <h3>Stay Motivated</h3>
            <p>Never fear even when the anwser does not appear to be clear: take a deep breath, regroup, and refocus. The answer lies in the details. </p>
