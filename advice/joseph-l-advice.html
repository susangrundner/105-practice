                <h4><span>Practice. Practice again!</span> Then pratice some more.</h4>
                <p>Practice makes perfection and this statement rings true in the world of coding. Apply the new skills you've learned in daily exercises and this will help you to not only retain the skills you've learned but will also get you comfortable with coding as well.</p>

                <p>There's so much to soak in that it can be overwhelming at times so it definitely helps you in the long run to get as much practice in as possible.</p>

                <h4><span>Research. Bookmark. Reference.</span></h4>
                <p>A valuable life skill to have is the habit of researching solutions for any issues you may have with coding challenges and projects. Google is an amazing tool and with the right keywords you can find exactly what it is you're looking for.</p>

                <p>I'd suggest going with the first five to six articles or links for the results and then filtering from there. Be sure to bookmark the page site that contains the most relevant information for your problem as you will most likely need it for later reference.</p>

                <p>Getting into this habit will save you lots of time and will help you to stay productive on your journey of coding. You've made it this far and there's much left to go!</p>
