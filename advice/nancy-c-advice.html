            I bought a set of Black and Red notebooks. I also got some funky
            stickers and pasted them on different notebooks so that I would know
            which book was which. (It also makes it fun too!)
          </p>
          <p>
            While I'm studying if something new comes up I'll quickly write a
            few notes or make some drawings. I find that writing things down
            while I'm learning helps the ideas "stick".
          </p>

          <p>
            I have a book for each subject I'm studying (HTML/CSS, Javascript,
            React, Python. I also have a notebook entitled "Passion Projects".
            I've made a list of apps I'd like to create. I keep ideas of things
            I need to learn before I can finish a project. That way I can better
            focus my learning and keep my goals in front of me.
          </p>

          <h2>"Layer" your Learning</h2>
          
          <p>
            What I mean by that is to learn from different sources. Sometimes
            when I'm learning a new concept I'll check out
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/"
              alt="MDN Developer Network"
              >MDN</a
            >
            or
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" alt="w3schools">w3schools</a>
            or I'll read different articles on some of the blogs that I follow.
            Sometimes having a concept explained different ways really helps to
            understand it. It also helps to see different ways to use a new
            tool.
