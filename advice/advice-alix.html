                <h4>Find a tribe</h4>

                <p>Learning to code is hard enought on your own. Find a community to help you through! #CodeNewbie is an excellent starting place on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>.</p>

                <h4>Tech success isn't built from luck or innate ability but rather consistent, sustained practice</h4>

                <p>It's easy to get caught up in a new lesson or project, to only let it die out or fall to the wayside when life hits. Create routines that allow you to 
                  regularly practice your skills. Make it a habit. 
                </p>

                <p>Make that time an appointment in your Google Calendar - it's just as important as a meeting! Don't shortchange your future self by bailing on that meeting.</p>
