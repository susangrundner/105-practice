                <h4>Take time every day!</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new skill, it is important to take time every day to work on it.</p>

                <p>There are going to be new terms and skills to learn every day, and if you let huge amounts of time pass in between practicing, you will have to re-learn those skill in order to move on.</p>

                <p>Life gets busy, but I suggest taking at least 30 minutes a day to practice your new skill.</p>

                <h4>Keep Going!</h4>
                <p>There will be bumps and twists in the journey of learning, but it is important to not give up.</p>

                <p>Look for the nuggets of success gold and use those as fuel to push you through the difficult times.</p>

                <p><strong>Use your resources!</strong> Talk to someone who knows better than you. Use the internet! Chances are, your problem has already been solved by someone and they probably posted about it online!</p>
