                <h3>Hi, my name is <span>Jennifer</span>. Here's some advice for you...</h3>
                <h3>Read the Literature Before You DO the Steps</h3>
                <p>Web Development is like learning a new language. Before you jump into the deep end of tech, I highly recommend to read through the lessons!</p>
 
                <p>As boring as reading can get, you will not be as lost and confused when working on each exercises. Oh, and not to freak out!</p>
 
                <h3>The More You Understand, the Better You'll Be.</h3>
                <p>To read is to learn. To learn is to apply. I am much of a doer in order to understand the technical aspects, but I retain the information just as much when I read through Skillcrush's lessons and grasp the new vocabulary.</p>
 
                <p>No one is perfect and is a master right off the bat, but you must understand what you are reading and practicing in order to save time later.</p>
 
                <p>Even if you don't do well the first time, the beauty of code and science is to try again.</p>
