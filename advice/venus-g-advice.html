                <h4>Be kind to yourself!</h4>
                <p>Starting out in your journey to coding WILL be frustrating. There are moments where you feel like you understand a theory. Then you put it into practice and you find yourself confused and struggling.</p>
                <p><span>THAT IS OKAY!</span></p>
                <p>Learning something new will always be frustrating. But you have to remember to be kind to yourself and understand that it is a process.</p>

                <h4>THE JOURNEY IS LONG BUT FULFILLING!</h4>
                <P>Learning to code is a life-long journey. You will always find yourself learning a new thing or something new about an old thing.</P>
                <p>That is part of your journey and you should learn to embrace it and find things you love about it. When you love something about the journey more each day, you learn to enjoy the journey, itself.</p>
                <p>What I'm saying is that the journey to being a professional coder will have lots of ups and downs. The key is to find something you love or like about the process to help make the journey more fun.</p>
                <p>Eventually, you'll find yourself enjoying the ride and being less frustrated. But even when you get frustrated about something, you'll find that you feel fulfilled when you solve the problem. This will repeat over and over, and you'll understand how fulfilling the journey really is. <strong>I promise.</strong></p>
                <p>Lastly, never give up. Remind yourself why you started and ignite that spark in you. <span>YOU CAN DO THIS!!!</span></p>
