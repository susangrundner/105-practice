            <h4>Feelings of fear and confusion are normal, but do not let them stop you.</h4>
            <p>Learning to program your first static webpage is <span>scary</span>. There are so many steps and rules, that it can feel overwhelming. That's okay. Take it one step at a time. Every developer started in the same place you did, and if they
                made it, then so can you.
            </p>

            <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity
                awaits.
            </p>
            <p>It's okay to ask for help and ask for help OFTEN! Utilize your community via the Slack channel, and if you have friends or associates who already have these skills, then get their feedback as well.</p>
