                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app, you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology, and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

                <p>You see, when you encounter a new programming language, part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

                <h4>When you start feeling overwhelmed, just pause and retrace your steps.</h4>
                <p>There will be moments when there is just information-overload! Not to mention that everything in our lives just need as much priority. Fortunately, the best and most painless way of handling this burnout is to just give the project a rest for the day. When you finally go back to it, you will see it with a fresher perspective. As you approach the project, go back as far as you think you may have gone off course. You can make that your new starting point.</p>
