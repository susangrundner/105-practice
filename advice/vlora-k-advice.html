              <h4><span class="advice-number">1</span>Huh, tech terms</h4>
              <p>
                Don't be discouraged by tech terms.
                If you want to learn a certain topic in tech, one way to understand and remember the theory about it is by asking yourself what problem is solved when we use that certain element.
              <p>
              <p>
                Let's say we have a written text in front of us, but we can hardly read it.
                First we determine what the problem is.
                In this case we can't distingush the title from the text, and we don't know when a paragraph starts and ends.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The theory or the answers for the problem can be H1 and p tags.
                  We can use H1 to solve the problem for the title.
                  We use p tag to solve the problem for the beginning and the einding of paragraphs.
                </p>

              <div class="advice-info-notes third-width">
                <h4><span class="advice-number">2</span>Make notes</h4>
                <p>
                  In tech the solution of a problem often contains several coding steps.
                  And it requires you to write the steps in sequential order.
                </p>

                <p>
                 For example: The topic is connecting local repo with remote repo in github.
                 In this case you can convert the topic into a question.
                 The question could be "How to connect a local repo with a remote repo?
                  Answer the question. Write each coding steps in sequential order.
                </p>
              </div>


              <div class="advice-info-motivation third-width">
                <h4><span class="advice-number">3</span>Motivate yourself </h4>
                <p> Treat yourself kindly. Use positive words instead of using words like ow it's going to take me forever to learn this.  Or I'm not smart enough for a tech job.</p>
                <p>Remind yourself every day why is beneficial for you to learn coding, design or any topic you choose to learn.</p>
                <p>Be patient. You don't have to remember everything right away, this comes with time, in the beginning the most important thing is to organize your information so that you can refer to it whenever you need it.</p>

              <p>
                Save your answers to problems or questions. You can save it in any format.<br />
                But one way to do it is by saving as png or jpeg, so you can open them as pictures or use it as flash cards for future reference.
