                <h4>Curiosity is an ASSET!</h4>
                <p>Never let anyone tell you that being curious and asking questions is a bad thing. You need to to be curious to learn new things.</p>
                <p>The adrenaline rush from doing something you didn't know how to is very intoxicating. I'm warnig you&#128562;</p>
                <h4>Dreaming is <span>not</span> free.</h4>
                <p>It is commonly accepted that dreaming is one of the last freebies available. I want to tell you that in my opinion it's not free.</p>
                <p>Now just because there is a cost does not mean that we should avoid imbibing. It only means that we should avoid becoming addicted to impossible
                  dreams. Here in lies the problem, once you truly dream something you are saying that it is possible. If you don't put your heart and soul into it you have
                  wasted your time.</p>
