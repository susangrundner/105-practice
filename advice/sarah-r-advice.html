                <h4>Learn from multiple sources</h4>
                <p>Let me start out by saying that Skillcrush is awesome.</p>

                <p>Second, when you learn something new, learn it from multiple sources. While one source may seem to cover everything, it's helpful
                to get a perspective from another source. This will help you practice and it will solidify your understanding of the topic as a whole.</p>
