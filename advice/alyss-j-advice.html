                <h4>Work Hard, Play Hard!</h4>
                <p>Have fun with what you do. Yes, there will be work involved, but have fun. Enjoy being creative, and know that even though the road may seem tough sometimes, a roadblock is just that: A block in the road.</p>

                <p>Holds especially true when learning something new. In tech, we can easily get overwhelmed by all the languages and different approaches to things. <strong>Don't let that intimidate you!</strong> Instead, approach things in a manor that will be easier for you. Don't take on too much. Sometimes, step away once, and come back and you'll see how easily you can now handle the task you couldn't before.</p></div>

				<h4><em>Live, Love, Learn</em> !</h4>
                <p>Learn as much as can in the fields you want to follow. Love what you do, and lastly, Live life to the fullest. Coding can provide a certain freedom, enjoy it.</p></div>
