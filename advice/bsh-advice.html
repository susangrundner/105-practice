          <h4>Stucture & Logic</h4>
          <p class="mix-match">Compared to other coding, HTML seems really easy. Hell compared to
            CSS, it is really easy! One thing to remember when coding HTML is
            <span>STRUCTURE!!!!</span> Structure is your best friend. You won't
            have a good HTML code, or a good CSS code, if your structure doesn't
            make sense.</p>
            <p>Another thing to add on with having good structure, is coding
              logically.  If your coding using a design from Photoshop or a
              screenshot to make a template, think about whether your sections
              align with your CSS code. Or if your CSS code doesn't have
              repeating codes.</p>
