                <h4>Take plenty of notes!</h4>
                <p>I find it helpful to take hand-written notes, especially when going through a process flow like making a new repo in Git. Writting something down helps you to remember it and you then have a copy to use as a quick reference.</p>
 
                <h4>Use your resources!</h4>
                <p>There are so many resources out there, including all the amazing things put together by Skillcrush! Don't be afraid to use them. You don't have to, nor should you, remember every single thing about coding. Even searching Google can get you the answer you need!</p>
