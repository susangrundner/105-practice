            This stuff is hard. If you're new to the tech industry and are making a career change from something completely different, learning to code really does feel like learning a foreign lanuage. <span>YOU CAN DO THIS!</span> Keep working at it, keep practicing, and don't be too hard on yourself.

           <h4>Keep working at it!</h4>

               It won't necessarily come easy...but it will come. I found a trick to help make some things a little less confusing. I started a binder where I would print off the provided "cheat sheets" and took some notes as I went along. It made it easier to refer back when I would start working on the projects. I also feel this is something I can refer back to in the future.
