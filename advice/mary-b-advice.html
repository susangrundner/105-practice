                <h3>Learning to code is a whirlwind!</h3>
                <p>Coding is hard! It's also exciting, fulfilling, and so much fun! The more I learn, the more I realize how much I still have to learn. That shows me that I will never get bored working in the world of tech. Things are constantly changing and that forces us to keep learning and growing!</p>
 
                <p>When things get frustrating, remind yourself that you're working towards a career that lets you evolve and keeps you thinking. You will get the chance to tackle different problems, create, and feel the satisfaction that comes from figuring it all out!</p>
 
                <h3>Keep pushing through the fog!</h3>
                <p>Even when nothing makes sense, trust that it will eventually. We are training our brains to think in code. Keep doing the work and one day that fog will lift and it will all be clear. The best coders in the world had to go through this hard beginning phase too. You're in good company!</p>
 
                <p>The only way you can fail is if you give up and that's not happening here! <span>You got this!</span></p>
