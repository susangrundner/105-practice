                <h4>Do it. A lot!</h4>
                <p>We all know the sickeningly cliche expression, "Practice Makes Perfect." This is true, but anyone who's taken a foreign language class knows that homework assignments and class activities, while helpful, do not provide a deep sense of mastery and ease in the language. The only way to become truly fluent in a new language is through <strong>immersion</strong>, often by spending a significant amount of time in another country and/or conversing regularly with native speakers. <em>Comprenez-vous?</em></p>

                <p>The amazing part of learning a programming language is that you don't need to travel the globe or set a lunch date to have these conversations, because <strong>the conversations are with your computer</strong>. So take some time, an hour or two a day (even on weekends), and have a cozy chat with your PC (or your Mac, if you're into that sort of thing).</p>

              <div class="topic" id="topic2">
                <h4>Look it up!</h4>
                <p>You are a clever and inventive visionary. An agent of change. A modernizer. A pacesetter. A radical groundbreaker. A curator of the finest set of thesauri.<br />You have <em>ideas</em>. You have a picture in your mind of how you want your website to look and what you want it to do, and it is <span id="breathtaking">breathtaking</span>... in your mind. But how do you make it look that way for others?</p>
                <p>Two key things to remember:
                  <ol id="list">
                    <li><strong>You are sitting at your computer.</strong> Right now. This is likely also true when you're programming, unless you prefer the old school method of coding with <span id="pen-and-paper">pen and paper</span> (you hipster).</li>
                    <li><strong>The internet knows everything.</strong> This may come as a shock to a cyberspace pioneer like yourself, but that <a id="hover" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=css+hover+text" target="_blank">fancy hover effect</a> you want to include has been done before. Fortunately it's been written about <em>at length</em>.</li></ol></p>
                <p>When you want to do a thing, and you don't know how, Google it. My brother-in-law, the lead source code engineer of a mobile app that had over 30 million downloads in it's first year, told me he conducts at least a couple dozen searches a day in the course of development. There is extensive information on anything you're able to do, and knowing how to find and interpret that information is an invaluable skill.</p>

              <div class="topic" id="topic3">
                <h4>Never. Stop. Learning.</h4>
                <p>The tech industry, by it's very nature, is always growing and evolving. Therefore, getting into the tech industry requires a willingness to grow and evolve with it. <span id="simple">Simple.</span></p>
              </div>

              <div class="topic" id="topic4">
                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="topic" id="topic5">
                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
