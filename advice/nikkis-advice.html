                <h4>Keep on practicing</h4>
                <p>The best way to make something you've learned really stick is to practice. Keep practicing with little projects, or create something that will help you in another area of life or another pursuit of yours. Also, reading books, blogs, and websites can help you become immersed in the language and aid in repetition to really get it into your brain.</p>
