                <h4>Be Patient, Keep Showing Up and Moving Forward.</h4>

                <p>Be patient with yourself and trust that if you keep moving forward, step by step, lesson by lesson, and practice, that it will soon start to make sense and really come together!<br> It can be overwhelming at first, just like learning any new language, and might sound like total gibberish to start! But just like learning, Spanish, for example, you first learn structure, rules and words before putting them together to make sentences.</p>

                <p>Once you learn how to form a sentence, you can make a paragraph, maybe even try a conversational exchange with someone. It doesn’t really start to sink in, unless you just do it! Practice over and over and be willing to make mistakes! Be patient and kind with yourself, knowing that every time you show up that is one small victory that will continue to add up to a larger one. Don’t forget to reward and encourage yourself for each small victory, acknowledging the progress you have made in committing to developing a new skill.</p>

                <h4>Use your resources! Ask for help and be helpful for others.</h4>

                <p>I try to figure something out on my own first. I find that sometimes by trying to figure it out on my own, I actually gain a better understanding of the concepts. By “messing up” or things not going perfectly smoothly, that’s where you really learn how to use your problem-solving skills. (It can be so satisfying to have identified and solved a problem on your own, however don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it!)</p>

                <p>If you try your hardest and can’t figure it out, use your resources: bookmarks that Skillcrush has recommended, Slack Channel and online forums. While you’re waiting for a response/solution, keep practicing, work on a different project. After some time away, you might even be able to come back with fresh eyes and identify the problem/solution right away. If not, someone else has had the same issue before and will be able to help you. Also, make sure to pay it forward and help others. By helping others try to problem-solve you will become a better problem-solver in general. And just think how thankful and relieved you were when someone else took the time to help you, especially with a most frustrating issue!</p>
