                <h4>Consistency is Key!</h4>
                <p>Do you find yourself studying and practicing only during weekend binge sessions? Try coding (mostly) every day!</p>
                
                <p>Even if it's just for 15 minutes each day, the consistency will help you develop the habits and skills you need to meet your coding goals.</p>

                <h4>Make it Fun!</h4>
                <p>Are there other hobbies or interests you want to blend into your tech life? Incorporate them into your projects!</p>

                <p>Use your newfound tech skills to solve problems in other areas of your life.</p>
