                <h3>Believe in Yourself!</h3>
                  <p>Be kind to yourself.  You're learning something new. Know that there will
                     be good days where you know, without a doubt, this is where you
                     are meant to be and then other days where you feel like you've hit a wall
                     and the doubt creeps in.  This is where you grow.  Don't give up
                     on you!
                  </p>
              <h3>Focus, focus, focus</h3>
                <p>You are here for a reason. Don't forget why.
                   Brush the dust off, revamp those goals if you need to, but don't
                   let them grow stale!
