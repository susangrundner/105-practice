                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="advice">
                <h4>It's OK to make mistakes!</h4>
                <p>Don't be afraid to make mistakes. No one ever broke the internet by making a coding error. In fact, cognitive scientists have proven that the best learning occurs when you engage in the problem solving required to fix mistakes. So be brave! Try, test, fail - and then, repeat until you succeed.</p>
