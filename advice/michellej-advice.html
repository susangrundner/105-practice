                <h4>No learning is lost.</h4>
                <p>If you have picked up and put down learning to code a dozen times, it doesn't matter! Any learning you have done is valuable and will make things easier if you have had to set aside your learning and come back to it. Nothing that you have learned in the past is wasted!</p>
 
                <h4>Keep going if you can - it makes things easier in the long run!</h4>
                <p>Gain an advantage by keeping up your momentum, even if it's only small and once a month! (If that's not possible for you, see tip #1 above. :) ) </p>
                
                <h4>Believe in yourself.</h4>
                <p>Cheesey but true. You plucked up the courage to try something new - not everyone does! You can learn to code. :) </p>
                
                <h4>Everyone has their own pace.</h4>
                <p>Not everyone that picks up coding becomes a maestro in a very short space of time. Don't worry about it if you have to stop and re-learn things thoroughly - some of us like to learn slow and steady, re-doing the basics over and over again, until they become second nature. Then, we can zoom ahead and catch up. Just learn at your pace in your own way; it will happen! :) </p>
