    </header>
    <div class='advice'>
      <h3>Banish self-doubt.</h3>
        <p>Imposter syndrome happens to everyone, so believe in yourself, and if you need to doubt something, doubt your self-doubt.</p>
        <br>
      <h3>Work really hard.</h3>
        <p>This seems obvious, but you get what you give, so get out of your comfort zone.</p>
        <br>
      <h3>Don't be afraid to get help.</h3>
        <p>The dev communinity is very helpful, and there are many resources to find answers to anything that is stumping you.</p>
        <br>
      <h3>Immerse yourself in the tech world.</h3>
        <p>Listen to podcasts, read articles, talk to like-minded people. Even if you have no idea what anything means, you will, eventually.</p>
