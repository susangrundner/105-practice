        <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something
          that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity,
          and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's
          probably never been done before.</P>
        <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right
          direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving
          pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig
          deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

        <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write
          your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go
          through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are
          looking at is doing this
          THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>
        <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and
          in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
        <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your
          learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train
          your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally
          understand what it's doing.</p>
