                <h3>10 Tips for Learning</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><p>Do it. Write a line of code. Write a second line of code. Write a code block.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Don't apologize. That is, don't lead with an apology. You're new to this. That's real.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Own mistake-making. Own it big. Own it often.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Giving up is just that. Stay curious as long as you can.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Look at your code in context. What specific thing are you trying to do?</p></li>
                    <li><p>"Listen" to code. Inspect source code. Play in developer tools. Turn the browser home page purple.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Talk through the lines of code. Explain what they do. Put it in comments. Code is always, always a busy little beast.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Set targets and articulate goals. Make a meaningful commit each day. Learning code parallels learning a language. What is it you want to do? What is it you want to say?</p></li>
                    <li><p>You can get stuck; you can get unstuck. Look for new ways to learn. Be kind to yourself.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Remind yourself that your learning process is yours, and is as individual to you as your eyes and your fingertips. Be curious about yourself. Discover how you learn.</p> </li>
                    <li><p>Discover what lets you be positive and shower yourself with that grace whenever. <span>Learning to code is really quite huge</span>. And learning something huge is <span>really quite brave</span>.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Be curious. Practice your learning.</h3>
