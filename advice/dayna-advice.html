                <h4>Form a Habit!</h4>
                <p>It's so easy to get lost in the excitement when you begin learning a new technology, only for that excitement to fizzle out after a few days.</p>
 
                <p>Instead of binging in the beginning, set up a <span>routine</span> that you can sustain over the next few months!</p>
 
                <h4>Practice!</h4>
                <p>Even when you assume you know how to do something, don't skip the practice!</p>
 
                <p>Sure, maybe you do understand the concept/how it works, but <span>repetition</span> is the key to becoming quick and comfortable with the material!</p>
 
                <h4>Take your Time!</h4>
                <p>You don't need to know <span>everything... right now</span>. Take small bites, and learn concepts fully one at a time. <span>You have time,</span> don't rush. </p>
