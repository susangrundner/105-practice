                <h4>Keep Your Goal in Mind</h4>
                <p>Not going to lie, its pretty hard giving someone else advice when you feel like your sinking into a bowl of Jello. For me, I have to remember <em>why</em> I am doing this. I want to be proud of myself. I want to get out of my current job I hate. I want to prove I can do it, and do it well. I'm still waiting for it all to really make sense and I can't wait for that moment.</p>

                <p>Find a buddy. I rely so much on the human interaction component of things, even on something so computer minded. Need a buddy? Contact me on slack..my name is Tara and Lake Tahoe is in my profile picture.</p>
