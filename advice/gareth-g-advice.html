                <p>When you first start programming it can be valuable to play around with many spheres of tech. I recently started my subscription with photoshop so I toy with design and editing images on the days I am taking a break from my Skillcrush lessons.</p>
 
                <p>Whilst learning about GitHub in the 105 course, I have started taking lessons on BitBucket too, just to learn the ins and outs of another git repo hosting service - they have some pretty great introductory lessons to boot, that have added to my Skillcrush knowledge!</p>

                <p>I also love W3, which is like an encyclopedia of tech knowledge and I refer back to it all the time to double check the work that I am doing and push myself further, as they have some incredible CSS suggestions - all laid out very neatly!</p>
