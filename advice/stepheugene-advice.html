                <h4>Have Patience with Yourself!</h4>
                <p>Anyone who ever accomplished something great, at one point did that great thing for the FIRST time. Wanting to be an expert is understandable, but rome wasn't built in a day. Take it one step at a time.</p>

                <p>Confusion is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Persistence Pays Off.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

                <p>Part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
