                <h4>Don't let your anxieties or uncertainties stop you!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. Or maybe you've dabbled but havemn't fully taken then the leap. Either way don't let you fears hold you back. It's ok to second guess yourself here and there and even stop for a short while because as we all know, life happens, but the point is to continue to push! Even if it's only for an hour a day. You <em>ARE</em> making progress! Keep moving forward!!</p>
 
                <h4>Notes are your best friend</h4>
                <p>We are given grear resources and cheat guides but writting or typing your own notes along the way could really help what your learning sink in even better. Plus it'll be something you can refer back on your own time, maybe even years after your done with the course that you can go back and look at if your ever stuck or unsure about a piece of code.</p>

                <h4>Practice, Practice, Practice</h4>
                <p>Learning most things technological being real hands on is a key factor. Dabble in the code with your own hands, tweak and play around to truly see what changes are happening (or not happening) to really get and understand whats happening. The more you play around the more it starts to feel like you got a better handle on it and becomes second nature for future references.</p>
