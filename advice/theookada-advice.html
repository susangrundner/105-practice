            <h4>Hesitation is normal, but try it anyways!</h4>
            <p>I've struggle (and still do) with anxiety and thinking "I don't think I am smart / brave / fast enough" to pursue something that I am interested in.  Programming and Coding are excellent examples of this. I have always wanted to try it, but I was afraid of not being good enough to try it.  So I went and studied something that I convinced myself that I liked which was Hospitality Management.</p>

            <p>Oh man, that was a mistake.  Not only did I think I wasn't good enough for that industry, I felt I made a horrible mistake and was ashamed about it and got depressed.</p>

            <p>I took some time and rethink my life and decided I should pursue what I want to do, which was more technology and web based.  Now that I am with Skillcrush, I feel like I am smart enough and it is quite fun.</p>

            <p>In life hesitation is normal, because you want to make the "right" decision.  But trying is still important, because regardless of the result you will end up more mature than before.</p>

            <h4>Do it until it is correct</h4>
            <p>Mistakes are an opportunity to do better the next time. Just be humble when there is a mistake and focus on making it right.</p>
