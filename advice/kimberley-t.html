                <h2>Believe in Yourself</h2>
                <p><span>W</span>hatever your goals are in life, the very first step to achieving it is believing that you can!  Mindset is huge and negative thinking can really set you back. On the other hand, the power of positive thinking and believing in yourself goes a long way!  </p>
 
                <p><span>B</span>elieving you can will help you when the going gets tough.  Negative thinking makes us want to give up too easily but positive thoughts can really help drive you forward.</p>
 
                <p><span>T</span>here are two types of mindset.  Growth mindset and fixed mindset.  First, let's talk about fixed mindset.  People with a fixed mindset believe that talent is required for success so there's no point in putting in effort.  Growth mindset, on the other hand, describes people who believe that learning and intelligence can be developed with time and experience.  In other words, effort directly impacts success.  Which mindset are you?</p>

                <h2>Goal Setting</h2>
                <p><span>M</span>ost everyone has heard of setting SMART goals. If you don't, it refers to Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Timebound.  While that's great for our small goals, it can hold us back when it comes to achieving our dreams.  So I say, dream as BIG as you can then break it down into smaller actionable steps that will move you forward toward achieving that big goal and that's where you can user your SMART goals! </p>
 
                <p><span>O</span>nce you know what your big goal is we want to break that down into smaller actionable steps.  In order to achieve our dreams, we need a plan to get there.  </p>
                    
                <p><span>T</span>he most productive way to plan is to write it down.  Start with your big goal, then break it down into monthly goals, weekly goals then daily goals.  Suddenly, those big dreams become SMART goals and you now exactly what steps to take ton turn them into reality!  </p>
