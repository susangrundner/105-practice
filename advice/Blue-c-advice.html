                      <p>When you start programming your first web app<br> you are doing something that you have never done before. <br> It's a new challenge, a new opportunity,<br> and in the case of software development, <br> something so specific - <br> that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                      <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. <br> It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit <br> that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper. <br> Keep going  because clarity awaits.</p>

                      <p>When you are learning a new technology,<br> whether you are learning to write your first programming language,<br> or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase<br> where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING <br>but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

                      <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology,<br> and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

                      <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language <br> part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. <br> The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code <br> even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
