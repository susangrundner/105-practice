                <h4>Fear is normal</h4>
                <p>You're venturing into new territory. Uncertainties abound. That's okay!</p>
                <p>Embrace it. Accept it. And, do it anyway. (Maybe talk to a friend about it over wine.)</p>

                <h4>Mistakes are good</h4>
                <p>...albeit frustrating.</p>
                <p>Struggle with it. Google it. Ask a fellow learner on Slack. Try Stackflow.</p>
                <p>You'll be better from it.</p>
