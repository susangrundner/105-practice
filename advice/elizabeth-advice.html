                <h4>Do What What You Gotta Do!</h4>
                <p>I knew when I first saw Skillcrush that I had to learn coding. I needed out of my old life and the only one who was going to take me there was myself.</p>

                <p>I didn't know anything about coding. And I can't say I know much now. But I am determined. You gotta do what you gotta do. No matter the cost or the time.</p>

                <p>It's your life and no one is going to care what you do with it as much as you do. Do <em>you</em> care? I hope you do. That's what this course has taught me.</p>

                <p>Right now, these things you're stumbling over will become second nature and you can fly through it. It's your <em> growing</em> phase right now. And one day you will stand tall and proud with the knowledge that you've learned. Because you did what you had to do.</p>

                <p>So go out there and make mistakes. I'm right there with you. All of us on these advice pages were--and more will come. Because we care to do what must be done.</p>
