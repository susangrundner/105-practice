                some motivation for you!</h1>

                <h4>You're new at this- it's okay to make mistakes!</h4>
                <p>We all started learning how to code due to different reasons: looking for a new job after being furloughed due to COVID-19, getting a first job, trying out a new hobby because you're bored with painting this week- whatever your reason may be, <strong>don't quit now</strong>!</p>

                <h4>You've come this far, so why quit now?</h4>
                <p>You're going to make mistakes, some things are going to be more exciting than others, and other things just seem like a nucance (why do we need to use 'em' as a measurement when 'px' works just fine? LOL).</p>

                <p>But do you remember how cool it was to finish your very first website, Jubilee Austen? And you bought a domain so you can send that link to your friends and family and say "Hey! Look what I made!" You gotta admit seeing that online for anyone to see is magical, and I don't know about you, but that's what keeps me going.</p>

                <p><em>I hope you keep going too.</em></p>
