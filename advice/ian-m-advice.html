                <h4>Take notes</h4>
                <p>It may seem obvious, but it's very tempting to rely on the computer to store all the information for you.</p>  
                <p>Taking notes on an actual notepad allows you to reference what you may be missing or stuck on, without having to cycle through windows, looking for the answer.</p>
 
                <p>Title the pages of your notes, and it will be very easy to find what you're looking for.  Faster too.</p>
 
                <h4>Google it</h4>
                <p>Something weird happened.  Oh no&excl; There's no info on Skillcrush or in your notes.  Don't worry, Google is your friend.</p>
 
                <p>Most of the issues you will have have been had by other people who have written asked or written about that issue online.</p>
 
                <p>What a better place to ask about your issues with the internet than the internet&excl; As the good doctor Steve Bruhl would probably say... <br><br> <span>&ldquo;Google it, you dummy&excl;&rdquo;</span></p>
