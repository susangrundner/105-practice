                <h4>Details Even For the Detail-Oriented</h4>
                <p>Follow each lesson like it's an important recipe. So many times I would get distraught thinking I didn't understand something and then I would go back line by line through the instructions and realize I had missed something. The fix was on a silver platter, it was so basic and I was off on another planet searching complex solutions online. <span>FACEPALM</span>. Sometimes it is really simple and you're OVERestimating a solution.</p>
 

                <h4>Just Show Up!</h4>
                <p>It is really that easy!! All you have to do is try a little bit everyday. </p>
 
 
 
                <p>Also - this seems the opposite - but it's also OKAY when you cannot show up. Don't be hard on yourself, just tell yourself "It's okay I didn't figure out why that background image wasn't working. It's <span>OKAY</span>."</p>
