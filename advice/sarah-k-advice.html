                <h4>Never, never, never give up!</h4>
                <p>Learning how to code is fun and exciting! And it&apos;s also REALLY diffcult!</p>
                <p>No matter how hard it is to find the answer to whatever coding conundrum you&apos;re working on, don&apos;t give up! Use every resource available to you to find a solution. And when in doubt, ask a friend!</p>
                <h4>Have fun with it!</h4>
                <p>I get it, sometimes going through step by step lessons can be boring! But don&apos;t forget to have fun with the bonus and final projects!</p>
                <p>I guarantee if you make the projects your own, you&apos;ll ending up learning more in the long run! You'll want to code up that awesome idea of yours to perfection if it's something you&apos;re excited about!</p>
