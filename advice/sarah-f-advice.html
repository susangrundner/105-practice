                <h4>Don't give up!</h4>
                <p>Learning to code can be very frustrating and you might want to give up (I know I do, sometimes!).Try to stay positive and keep practicing. It's hard to learn new things but will be worth it in the end.</p>
                <h4>Remember you're not alone.</h4>
                <p>Communicate with your fellow skillcrushers through the Slack community. It's great to get on there and ask questions or look for answers to questions you have. Most likely, someone else had the same question at some point. It also feels good to know that you're not alone in this learning to code journey!</p>
