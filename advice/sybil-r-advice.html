                <h4>Confusion is natural when learning a new language!</h4>
                <p>Your journey will not be easy I have never heard someone say different.  I have learned in my own journey that sometimes I have to be exposed to and try something 3 times before it starts to make sense.</p>
 
                <p>When you reach that point where new information starts to make sense...well, that is a eureka moment.</p>
 
                <h4>There are many ways to do something.</h4>
                <p>Sometimes you need to take a break to mentally process a change in mental processing.  I am moving from a career where 100% accuracy is expected to one where troubleshooting is expected.</p>
 
                <p>The struggle is normal you are on both a mental and emotional journey.  Do not forget the picture you have of your future!  If you do and loose your grit you will not get there.  You will go back to what was, what is "safe".</p>
 
                <p>Do not see each of these struggles as a detour or a roadblock see them as paving stones for your path.  Soon you will be skipping along with a smile on your face and a lightbulb above your head!</p>
