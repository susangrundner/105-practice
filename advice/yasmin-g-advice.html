                <h4>Do what you love!</h4>

                <p>People that do what they love never work one day in their lives. I heard this once before and I thought they were crazy. But its true!</p>
 
                <p>Working hours are shorter because time flies when you have fun.</p>

                <p>Performance inproves. Its simple: you donÂ´t do it because you have to, but because you want to.</p>
 
                <p>Its true not everyday will be amazing. But those painful days are worthy when the other 90% you enjoy what you are doing.</p>
