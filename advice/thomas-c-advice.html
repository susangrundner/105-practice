            <div class="advice">
                <h4>Just jump right in!</h4>
                <p>It can be daunting starting to learn a new skill especially if you are working full time and have been out of school for a while. That's why I recommend not to over think it and just start learning! There's no rush in learning something new and only future benefits.</p>
 
                <p>It's easy to find excuses to put off studying and to have fun or just relax; but, you've got to put those feelings aside and come to realize that you are doing this for your future and that you can rest when you're done!</p>
 
                <h4>Take a step back and see how far you've come.</h4>

                <p> You need to put be consitently be doing you're lessons and working on the next step. That doesn't mean that you can't take a small break or reward yourself after completing a diffulcult session. I find taking a breather and looking back at what I've done can be excellent motivating to keep on chugging away.</p>
 
                <p>I hope this advice will help someone along their journey and I know you have it in you. Keep doing the work and I'm sure we'll both be well on our way to becoming amazing coders in no time!</p>
