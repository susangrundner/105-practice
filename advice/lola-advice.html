                    <h2>Never Back Down</h2>
                        <p>In life, we are constantly being faced with challenges. Hit on every side by opposition, especially when we are trying to better ourselves and make a positive change for our future. Do not let the naysayers make you doubt yourself.
                        <p><strong>Do not apologize for your dreams!</strong></p>
                        <p>Everyone is fighting the fight of self-discovery. Do NOT back down from yours!</p>

                    <h2>Never Give Up</h2>
                        <p>There is a quote I have as the background on my phone that serves as a reminder to never give up.</p>
                        <div id="quote-box"><h3>Don't you give up.<br> Don't you quit.<br> You keep walking.<br> You keep trying.<br> There is help and happiness ahead.<br> It will be alright in the end.<br> Trust God and believe in good things to come.</h3>
