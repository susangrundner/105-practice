                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>What are we doing? How do I make this box the right size? How about a button? Why won't these tags work? Why does it make sense in the explainer video but seem impossible when I'm trying it?</p>
                <p>Take a breath. It's going to be fine! And fun! Embrace the confusion, stay curious, and ask for help when you need it!</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>I don't know how else to say it, but this is great advice. And it's hard for me, personally, to follow; I like to understand the "why's" and "how's" of things. But in this case, sometimes it won't all make good sense until later.</p>
                <p>And that's ok.</p>
