      <h4>Learning to code will be tough...</h4>
      <p>...but so worth it! Learning to code is like learning a new language (quite literally...). It's going to be
        confusing at first and it's going to take a lot of practice and perseverance. When you get stuck and start
        feeling frustrated, give yourself a break. When you come back, you'll be refreshed and ready to tackle the
        problem!</p>

      <h4>The internet is your friend</h4>
      <p>The internet is a wonderful tool and will more than likely have an answer to all your coding questions. Get in
        the habit of doing your own research before asking a peer, it'll keep your problem-solving skills in tip-top
        shape and with so many great coding resources out there, chances are that you'll find your answer way faster
        that way.</p>
      <p>If you just can't wrap your head around a problem, reach out to the coding community through forums like <a
          href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions">Stack Overflow</a> or the Skillcrush community on Slack.</p>
