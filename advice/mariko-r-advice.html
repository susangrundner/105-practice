                <h4>Try the Pomodoro Technique!</h4>
                <p>Sometimes it can be hard to motivate yourself to keep up with your Skillcrush classes, especially when you feel like you're not making progess. This is when I like to use the <span class="pomodoro">Pomodoro Technique</span>, invented by developer (hey!) Francisco Cirillo.</p>

                <p>Set a timer for 25 minutes and work without any distractions. When time is up, take a 5 minute break. This 30 minute chunk of time is called a <span class="Pomodoro">"Pomodoro"</span>. After 4 <span class="Pomodoro">Pomodoros</span>, take a longer break. It's amazing what you can accomplish when you have to work for just 25 minutes at a time!</p>
