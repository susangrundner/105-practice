                    <h4>Practice, Practice, Practice!</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When you start coding your first website, you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and it's exciting! There are so many little details to remember, but the more you do it, the more information you retain and soon, you'll be fluent in a whole new language!</li>
                        <li>Don't be afraid to start again. I got caught in a rut a few times and completely deleted all of my HTML and CSS and started from scratch. The second go around often ended up completely error free!</li>
                        <li>Take advantage of all of your online resources. There are so many free projects out there to keep you coding and practicing all of your new skills.</li>

                    <h4>Push Through the Hard Times</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Confusion can set in, frustration can overcome us. Be patient with yourself but keep going! There is light on the other side!</li>
                        <li>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</li>
                        <li>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</li>
