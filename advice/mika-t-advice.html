                        social media when you feel mental fatigue set in try getting up for a short walk outside or make a cup of tea or coffee.  
                        This allows your brain to continue mulling over the new information and stay within the new task while taking a gentle break</p>

                <div class="Building-focus">  
                <p>When you are starting to learn something new, it can be tiring.  Instead of trying to be busy all day learning a new skill,  try to spend the time of day when you feel freshest doing the most challenging work. </p>
                    <p>By prioritizing the new skill or project you are currently working on for when you feel freshest you can get your best work done.</p>
                    <p>Other less useful projects like catching up on email can be left to later in the day after your most important tasks are complete</p>
