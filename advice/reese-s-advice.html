                    <p>Find comfort in trusting yourself.</p> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Know that you have made a great investment in your future by participating in this program.</li>  
                            <li>Know that you are never alone.</li>  
                            <li>Know that right now there are people, learning with you, at your age, who look just like you.</li>  
                            <li>And know that there are people who were exactly where you are now, and that are now your caring instructors.</li>  
                        </ul>
                    
                    <p>Be prepared to blaze a path for everyone looking to you for inspiration.  So that they will know that they 
                        can continue within this cycle of achievement.  And remember to feel just as confident in your struggles 
                        as you do in your victories.  You are valued, and you are worthy.
