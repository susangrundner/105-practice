                <h4>I hope you like puzzles!</h4>
                <p>Programming is much like completing a puzzle that's full of pieces that look the same. However, that's where the beauty comes in.</p>

                <h4>Google, and Youtube, and Github.... <strong>OH MY!</strong></h4>
                <p>Learning how to research is one the most important things in this line of work.</p>
                <p>While it is understood that you may not know everything at that moment. It is important that you learn the skills to get the job done.</p>
                <p>Using resources such as Google, Youtube, and Github is a great way to get things done.</p>
