            <h1>Hi my name is Yasmeen and I have some advice for you!</h1>
        </header>

        <section>
            <div class="advice">
                <h4>Break out the Cheatsheets</h4>
                <p>Memorize the common Terminal & GIT commands as soon as you possibly can. Trust me when I tell you that it will make EVERYTHING easier!</p>

                <h4>Join a local meetup group</h4>
                <p>If there's a local web development or front-end developer meetup you can join, I encourage you to do it! I find the help that I receive from meetups invaluable, and making new friends is always fun.</p>

                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

                <h4>Keep calm and carry on</h4>
                <p>Try not to get too frustrated when you encounter problems. One moment everything makes sense, and I'm making great progress. Then a few minutes later, I'll encounter a problem that sets me back for hours.</p>

			          <p>Coding can be frustrating. When you get frustrated, you should take a break.</p>

			          <p>Finally, other people have probably mentioned this. Still, it's worth repeating - code a little everyday rather than a lot at one time. I find it's easier to retain information in small bits rather than large chunks. Good luck!!!</p>
