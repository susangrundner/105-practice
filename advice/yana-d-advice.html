                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>I get it. I was there too. When I first started, I felt like coding was too abstract. I am a very visual person, so I needed to clearly visualize everything in order to understand it. It took me some time to get used to it, but I eventually did it! The Skillcrush course is amazing in the sense that all the lessons are very well structured, explanations are very clear amnd you can always rely on help from the tutors whenever you get stuck. And yes, you will most probably get stuck at some point. But you'll find your way. You always will :) </p>

                <h4>Keep learning and practicing!</h4>
                <p>Life can easily get on the way. That happened to mee too - I had to stop coding for two months and now I realize what a mistake that was. I should have continued learning even if it was for two hours a week. It's easy to forget things. Hence, my advice would be to keep practicing and keep learning. You'd definitely appreciate it later when you don't have to go again through all the lessons!</p>
