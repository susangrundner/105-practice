        <h4>Be Patient</h4>
        <p>There is so much information out there! It's easy to be overwhelmed with how much there is to learn and frustrated with how long it takes to learn it. Give yourself the time and patience you would give someone else who is learning something new. You'll be a pro in no time!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="half-width consistent">
        <h4>Be Consistent</h4>
        <p>It's important to be consistently learning and practicing. I have found doing at least one lesson a day is a good way to ensure you stay on track. If you feel like you need a day off from the lessons, make an effort to watch a master class, listen to a tech related podcast, or read the Skillcrush blog instead!</p>
