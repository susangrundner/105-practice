                <h4>Frustration is a good sign</h4>
                <p>When you first start programming, your instructor will make it look easy but it in practice, doing your first project can be frustrating. </p>

                <p>Frustrating? yes! but not to worry because this is a good thing - trust me. Frustration will make you spend more to researching from many sources, which helps drive your curiosity and your devotion to the subject matter. When you finally complete your first project on your own, you will be two-stepping just like i did in my living room. Thats the power of frustration. Its a good thing.</p>

                <h4>Perseverance is key</h4>

                <p> In programming perseverance is important, you have to make sure you never give up easily otherwise you may never succeed, so make sure you stay strong no matter what it takes.</p>

                <p>If you don't give up, you will learn to trust your work and build confidence as you grow. When you build confidence, you are respected, when you are respected, you are promoted.</p>
