                <h4>Getting to Carnagie Hall .com</h4>
                <p>The only thing that truly makes all of the gears start to<br> click is practice, practice and more practice.<br>I try and find new ways to customize or change things<br>to improve them. Often, this breaks them first. I try and use<br>this as a chance to practice troubleshooting! </p>

                <p>I need to be better at this one. Things break. Typos happen.<br>It is EASY to miss a missing . - look how small that is!<br>Take a deep breath and go over it again. You'll find the error.<br>Sometimes, I find it best to just walk away for a while, or sleep on it.<br>When I pick it up again, with a clear head, I usually find the error quickly!</p>
