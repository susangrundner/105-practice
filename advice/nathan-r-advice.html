                <p>When you begin this journey you will feel overwhelmed at first.</p>

                <p> <span>Hang in there!</span> It will begin to come together and make more sense. The many questions you hold in the back of your mind will be answered as you get deeper into the lessons.</p>

                <h4>Practice, practice, practice!</h4>
                <p>Like in most things, <span>practice makes perfect</span>.</p>

                <p>Designate some time in your day as "playtime" to simply explore what different bits of code can do.</p>
