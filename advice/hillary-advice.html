          <section>
              <div>
                  <h3>Don't give up!</h3>
              </div>
                      <p>This is brand new! Be proud of yourself that you are attempting to learn something new and step outside of your comfort zone. Learning to code is like learning a new language except you already know all the words. It is ok if you don't understand everything immediately and it is ok if you step away for a bit. Take some time, mull things over, try a second (third or forth) time, then come back and try again.</p>


              <div>
                  <h3>Do your best!</h3>
                      <p>Do the best you can! This is a learning process - these things take time. It is ok if it isn't perfect but give it your best shot.


              <h3>Ask for help</h3>
                  <p>It is ok if you don't know everything - you're still learning! Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. Google is a great resource for information as are the people at Skillcrush - they are terrific and tremendously helpful.
