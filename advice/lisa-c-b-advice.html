                <h4>Don't discount all that you do know.</h4>
                <p>It is so easy to focus on everything that you feel that you don't know.  In reality there is so much that you do know and you shouldn't take that for granted.</p>

                <p>A simple trick is to ask yourself what you knew about coding one week ago, two weeks ago, one month ago, one year ago.  I bet you now feel a lot more confident about the knowledge that you do possess.</p>

                <p>Now put a reminder in your phone for one week from now.  No, really, go do it.  I will wait.  The reminder should say, "I feel that I know nothing about (fill in the blank).  What do I know about it now?  Now I will celebrate what I have learned!"</p>

                <p>So in a week let's talk about all that you know, all that you will know and all that you will continue to learn.</p>
                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
