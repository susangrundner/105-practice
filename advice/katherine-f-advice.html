                <h4>Keep taking action!</h4>
                <p>There are times when I've felt completely overwhelmed, confused and have questioned whether I have the right brain type to even be a good coder. What I've found to be the most helpful when this happens is to recognize the thought/feeling and refocus on my commitment to take action.</p> 

                 <p> This helps me focus on learning, which builds my skills and my confidence</p>
 
 
                <h4>A few other things that have helped me:</h4>
                <ol>
                	<li> taking notes </li>
                	<li> reviewing my notes at the end of a study session </li>
                	<li> taking breaks and moving my body </li>
                	<li> reading code as much as I can </li>

                </ol>
