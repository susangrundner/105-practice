          <h2> Hello! My name is Lisa Renee (no it's my first and middle name not only my first). I thought I would share some advice that I've experimented with in my coding journey.</h2>

          <h3> Take Breaks! </h3>
          <p> Seriously. This is something I usually have to force myself to do. Taking breaks away from coding or from a project allows our brain to process what we're learning and what we've done. It allows us to come back to said project with a clear and open mind. Sometimes if stare at our projects for too long we start making mistakes and we get frustrated and wonder why isn't it working?! Yeah. So definitely go take a break and do something different. Like...</p>

          <h3> Drink Water... not just coffee or tea! Or Monsters...</h3>
          <p> Did you know our bodies are made of roughly 70-90% water? If you want more reasons to drink water, I found this <a href= "https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/why-is-water-important"> article from Healthline</a> giving you 16 reasons more to drink water and all the way at the end of the article is some recommendations about consumption. I'm not a doctor but I did think the article was helpful and interesting.</p>

        <div class= "tip-deco">
          <h3> Move your body!</h3>
          <p> No you do not have to get on the floor and do a milllion push ups. But that being said, getting up and moving around at least a little bit has been known to improve cognitive function. That means our brains work better. Amazing! In addition to helping our brains out, moving around and not sitting for hours on end is also good for our heart and lungs. If you want more information about heart health, I recommend going to the <a href= "heart.org"> American Heart Association</a> website for information on the heart and moving your body more. Again not a doctor, but I do believe that the better care we take of our bodies, the better our brains will be able to code.</p>

        <div class= "tip-deco">
          <h3> Read! </h3>
          <p> We've all heard that reading is good for you.  It reduces stress, improves memory and brain connectivity. <a href= "https://www.bustle.com/p/what-does-reading-do-to-your-brain-these-5-effects-are-pretty-astounding-74676"> Bustle</a> and <a href= "https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-athletes-way/201401/reading-fiction-improves-brain-connectivity-and-function"> Psychology Today</a> both have articles that explore this topic further. But my top reason for reading is classic: a great story and a new perspective. If you're looking for some great fiction, I recommend Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson series, <em>A Wrinkle in Time</em> by Madeline L'Engle, and <em>A Discovery of Witches</em> by Deborah Harkness. Some of the more recent nonfiction I've read and recommend is <em>Everything is Figureoutable</em> by Marie Forleo, <em>Mindset</em> by Carol Dweck, and <em>Love What Is</em> by Byron Katie and Stephen Mitchell. If you've read those and need more recommendations, go to <a href= "https://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a>.</p>

          <h3> Try something new</h3>
          <p> There are many benefits of trying new things. <a href= "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-look-at-the-incredible-benefits-of-trying-new-things_b_59196b49e4b02d6199b2f129"> Huffpost</a>, <a href= "https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/happiness-in-world/201004/trying-new-things"> Psychology Today</a>, and <a href= "https://wanderlust.com/journal/why-you-should-try-new-things/"> Wanderlust blog</a> all give wonderful reasons for trying new things. Even <a href= "https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/stuck-rut-my-top-tips-trying-something-new-2019"> Richard Branson</a> of Virgin encourages trying new things. It helps to build courage, personal growth, and stimulating creativity. If you need some suggestions, <a href= "https://www.insider.com/things-you-should-try-in-the-new-year-2018-12">Insider.com</a> has 50 of them. </p>

          <h3> Code a little bit everyday </h3>
          <p> Practice, practice, practice! Even if all you do is <strong>one</strong> paragraph of coding. You've practiced. You rock!</p>

        <div class= "tip-deco">
          <h3> Have fun!</h3>
          <p> Part of this journey is having fun creating something new! I won't say it's all sunshine and daisy pops but having a little bit of fun figuring out our coding is totally part of the description. Or it totally should be any way!</p>
