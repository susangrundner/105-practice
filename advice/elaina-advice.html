                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
 
                <p>Confusion is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>

It's all about training your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing. </p>
