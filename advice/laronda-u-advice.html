                <h2>Start small!</h2>

                <p>When you start the learning process it is easy to feel overwhelmed by how much there is to learn. Focusing only on the small next step helps you keep perspective and to keep going.</p>

                <h2>You will feel like you will never get it.</h2>

                <p>This will happen at times but is temporary. It will pass. When it happens and you feel frustrated, do not give into the temptation to throw your computer out the window. Just walk away, take a break, do something enjoyable and come back to it when you feel refreshed.</p>
