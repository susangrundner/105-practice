                <h4>Don't be afraid of breaking your code.</h4>
                <p>Always make a backup and save often. Then dig in and have fun!</p>

                <h4>Keep your code clean and simple.</h4>
                <p>Think about solving problems before writing your code. Think as much about deleting code as you think about writing code.</p>

                <h4>Remember that coding is a team effort.</h4>
                <p>Write helpful comments. And, always document your work.</p>
