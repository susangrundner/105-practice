                <h4>If it scares you, it's a good thing to do (provided it isn't brandishing a weapon)</h4>
                <p>Your comfort zone is lovely - warm and fluffy and, as the name suggests, comforting, but staying in it won't let you learn or grow, and both of these are essential parts of life.</p>

                <p>Programming is scary. Learning any new skill that's foreign to you at first is scary. But anything that scares you is challenging you, and challenges are a source of deep and abiding satisfaction, and a way of really finding out who you are and reaching towards who you will become. Why limit yourself just because you're scared?</p>

                <h4>Being gentle is just as important as being brave</h4>
                <p>Even while you're being a kick-ass boss at whatever the hell is scaring the living daylights out of you, be sure to be gentle on yourself at the same time. Pushing yourself is important, but beating yourself up for making mistakes (which are essential), for getting scared (which is normal) or for feeling out of your depth is not gong to help anyone. It's going to make it harder.</p>

                <p>Be gentle on yourself. Be kind to yourself. Try to avoid the negative talk that bubbles to the surface. You're doing a good thing by pushing yourself. You're being brave. So be kind as well. And start with yourself.</p>

                <p><em>Stick at it. You're doing a great job.</em></p>
