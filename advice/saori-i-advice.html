                <h4>It's totally okay to take your time.</h4>
                <p>When you learn something new, it takes time. Sometimes you might feel like your fellow skillcrushers learn so much faster than you and you are not good enough to learn coding.</p>
 
                <p>It's not true. You are absolutely good enough to learn coding. You are already awesome because you bravely started this journey.</p>
                
                <p>Other people might get HTML done super quick but they might be stuck with Git. While you struggle with HTML you might be rocking when it comes to Java.</p>

                <p>Other people might have a prenty of time available, while you are a mom of four. It is ok to learn at your own pace. Remember, everything happens to you with perfect timing for you.</p>
