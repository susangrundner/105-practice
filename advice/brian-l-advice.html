                <h4>Confusion is only a state of mind!</h4>
                <p>You don't want to make any mistakes, but you cannot learn without making some!</p>
                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction.</p>
                <h4>Fear plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, you have to push the envelope or you will stay in the same position. Unchanged.</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

                <p>When you encounter a new programming language, part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing. It's uncomfortable for most Newbies.</p>
