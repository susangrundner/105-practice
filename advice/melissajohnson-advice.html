                <h4>Don't let merge conflicts scare you!</h4>
                <p>Skillcrush does a great job walking through resolving merge conflicts. Bookmark it and practice it. It will save you and your team a lot of stress.</p>
                
                <p>I've worked on teams where developers will create elaborate manual processes purely to avoid having to deal with merge conflicts. It usually stemmed from the front-end developer who was concerned about mis-managing back-end code. However, it was difficult to remember these processes and therefore, many other developers didn't follow them. It would be easier to allow for the conflicts and Slack or pick up the phone to work with the conflict author to resolve. Github makes it easy to identify who submitted what. :)</p>
