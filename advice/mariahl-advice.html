                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that your are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you k now that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fat, it's a critical part of the process</p>

                <p> You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learnign to train your eye. The way you to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
