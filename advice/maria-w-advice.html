        <h4>Don't be afraid to make mistakes.</h4>
        <p>
          It's very easy for us to be afraid of making mistakes which leads to
          us not making any progress because we are stuck in our 'Perfect phase'
          where HTML and CSS looks cute and well organised. The only way to get
          better at what you are doing is to make lots of mistakes and in that
          process, go out there and look for solutions. Some may be just what
          you're looking for, others will leave you questioning that developers
          skills and others will be a middle ground where you can go in and add
          your personal touch to make it a perfect and unique solution for you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mistakes need to be your bestfriend and not your enemy because they
          push you to be a better person and in turn, helps you give others
          better service.

        <h4>Quality over quantity!</h4>
        <p>
          I know that at the end of the day, we all want to have a portfolio
          that has tons of work to showcase to employers but i'm here to tell
          you that even three quality works in your portfolio can beat the one
          with 30 works that have no value to the employer. Aim to work on
          projects that will showcase the skills you have that can solve
          problems that future employers or recruits may be facing in their
          company. This will set you apart because you have positioned yourself
          as a problem solver and not just a developer or maker of pretty
          things.
