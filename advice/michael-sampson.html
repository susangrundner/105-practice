                <h4>Failure Is Good</h4>
                <p>Failure is the greatest teacher, so dont be afraid to fail.</p>

                <p>This means failure is GOOD! Because it teaches you by showing you what not to do</p>

                <h4>Remeber Why You Are Doing This</h4>
                <p>Whatever your reason is for learning to code, stick with it. With patience and fortitude comes great reward</p>

                <p>Know that in the end, you are learning something that can change your life for the better</p>

                <p>And remember the wise words of Master Yoda. "Dont just try, do."</p>
