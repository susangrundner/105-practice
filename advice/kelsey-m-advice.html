                <h4>We all have Imposter Syndrome!</h4>
                <p>Technology is constantly changing and no one is an expert in all things coding. It's impossible! We all struggle with moments of doubt, but that is where a supportive community is the best! Having a couple people who can cheer you on in your moments of doubt is essential.</p>

                <p>No question is a dumb question and mistakes are the pathway to success! Don't fear asking a question in the developer community. You are learning and most devs are more than happy to lend a helping hand. You only get to be a beginner once, so take advantage and ask for help! It doesn't make you less of a developer, in my opinion, it makes you a better developer!</p>

                <h4>Celebrate the litte successes.</h4>
                <p>It's very easy to gloss over the little things, but <strong>don't</strong>.</p>

                <p>There will be plenty of times you get stuck and confused. Learning to celebrate the little wins help make the hard times easier to manage.</p>
