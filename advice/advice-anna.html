                <h4>It won't seem like you're learning much at first</h4>
                
                <p>At first, it felt like I was dumping new information in my brain every day, but that nothing was 
                    sticking. I didn't think it was ever going to come together and that I'd really be able to do 
                    anything real with what I was learning!</p>

                <p>But one day I was working on a project, and I realized that I knew what I was doing or at least 
                    knew where to get answers. I really was learning!
                </p>


                <h4>Just keep putting in the time every day</h4>
                 
                <p>I've heard in many disciplines a little bit of time every day is better than a lot of time spent 
                    sporadically. I feel this is very true in coding! When I miss a day or two in my coding practice 
                    it sets me back and I need to do more review and catching up. When I do at least a little every day
                    it feels like it keeps things fresh in my brain, and I'm able to keep making progress more quickly.
                </p>
                <p>So even on the days you don't have much time, try and put in at least a few minutes!</p>
