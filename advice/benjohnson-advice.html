                <h4>It's okay to be confused.</h4>
                <p>When you're just starting out, you won't know how to do everything. It will be confusing! That's good and necessary! Lean in to the discomfort. You'll figure it out.</p>

                <h4>Google is your best friend.</h4>
                <p>You really don't have to memorize everything! It's perfectly okay to use your resources &mdash; I promise it isn't cheating. You'll memorize more the more you code!</p>

                <h4>Take a deep breath (and maybe a walk).</h4>
                <p>Getting frustrated that your code isn't working like you want it to? Take a quick mental break and come back to it refreshed! It helps to see the code with fresh eyes.</p>
