                <h4>Be ready for an infinity of problems!</h4>
                <p>I can't even begin to count how many times I sat at my computer and thought
"Gosh! where do I even begin?!" and then doubted my skills or capabilities to overcome the task, and felt the temptation to ask somebody for help. But I think one of the best tips I read was "you're not a programmer, you're a problem solver", This helped shift my perspective from "Am I good enough to do this?"
to ""Let's see how we can find a solution to this problem". Perhaps coding is very much like doing sudoku or solving a crossword, or putting together a puzzle. As a problem solver, you expect problems!

                <h4>All doors have a key</h4>
                <p>Following from the last point, I can't even begin to count the number of times I've thought I couldn't solve THIS problem, but the truth is that it's all in starting, and insisting, sticking at it. Everything will unfold little by little. The solution is really out there, ALWAYS!

                </p>

                <h4>It's inevitable</h4>
                <p>Keep pushing, the problem WILL buckle.</p>
