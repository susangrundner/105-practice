            <h1>Hi, my name is Rebecka and I have some advice for you!</h1>

                <h4>Be a Slacker!</h4>
                <p>Slack is a great tool for not only getting answers to your inevitable questions, but also for giving you the opportunity to help others in the Skillcrush community! I highly recommend not only using Slack when you have a problem, but also checking in each day or as often as your schedule permits.</p>

                <p>Sharing successes as well as roadblocks, and seeing others encounter them as well, helps me to realize that we're all in this together. Despite doing this coursework 100% from my living room, I feel connected to the others around the world who are also engaged in learning about coding & design.</p>

                <h4>Keep on Truckin'</h4>
                <p>I had the idea early on in my Skillcrush career that I'd take a break after completing the HTML and CSS course to work on our family business website update. I thought that with another example of a website that I coded on my portfolio, this would be helpful for me to show potential clients.</p>

                <p>After taking a few weeks off to work on that, I realized that if I kept working on the Skillcrush coursework as it's laid out, I would be better equipped to update our website once I was done with the Responsive Website course, and even Javascript.</p>

                <p>If you're feeling like you should be doing something else as well as the Skillcrush coursework, I would encourage you to just stick to the Skillcrush curriculum and power through. I feel like once I get through Git, Responsive Websites, and Javascript, I'll be able to work much more efficiently on our family business website. I'm wrapping up Git soon, and we'll see how I feel after finishing the next few courses!</p>
