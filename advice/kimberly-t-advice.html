                <h4>Slack is your friend!</h4>
                <p>The community on Slack is incredibly helpful. Join the channel for the class you are working on. If you are having a problem, chances are, somebody else has had the same issue. Use the search function to see if your question has already been asked. You can quickly find answers to a lot of questions this way.</p>

                <h4>Don't be afraid to ask for feedback.</h4>
                <p>If you have a question about your code, use the "Feedback Challenge" to ask. The instructors are super helpful. You don't have to go it alone.</p>

                <h4>Join other coding communities.</h4>
                <p>You can get additional support and begin networking with other developers by joining groups outside of Skillcrush. Facebook has some great groups for web developers.</p>
