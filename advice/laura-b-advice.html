                    <h4>Just start.</h4>
                    <p>It has taken a quarantine to force me to finally put some meaningful time into this course, but I see now just how much I could have learned even doing a couple hours of work a week.</p>

                    <p>Little by little, you will find yourself learning a brand new skill you never imagined you could know. But you have to start somewhere.</p>
                </div>  
                <div class="section-two">
                    <h4>Take your time.</h4>
                    <p>This journey has taken me two years... so far. I kept coming up with excuses to not continue, but they were never enough to stop me completely.</p>

                    <p>No matter how long it takes, it is worth it. You don't have to let the fear of failure take over.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section-three">
                    <h4>Start over again if you need - or want - to.</h4>
                    <p>There will always be roadblocks. I have had months between lessons, and I always came back feeling completely lost.</p>

                    <p>If you find yourself in the same boat, don't worry. It doesn't mean you shouldn't continue. It is completely normal to have to take a step back and find your footing.</p>
                
                    <p>I even had to re-learn how to ride a bike, and isn't there a saying about not needing to?</p>
