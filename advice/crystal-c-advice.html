                <h4>Stay as consistent as you can.</h4>
                <p>Consistency matters overall. If you get off course, make a route to jump back into your studies when you can. It's important to say, "Hey, this is important to me."</p>
                <p>Even just 5 or 10 minutes of study can help you get back to being consistent and start on a regular schedule.</p>

                <h4>Have fun with it.</h4>
                <p>I am the most inspired when I am working on something with a playful attitude. I just keep practicing projects on my own until I'm comfortable with what I've learned from them.</p>
                <p>Creativity is the best learning partner.</p>
