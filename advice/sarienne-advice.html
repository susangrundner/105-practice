                <h2>Consistency</h2>
                <p>When learning something new, it is important to stay consistent. Practice often and regularly so that the concepts will stick. You will find a groove and be able to sink into it faster each time you come back.</p>
 
                <h2>Organization</h2>
                <p>Develop good habits from the start. Stay organized and neat so that each time you come back to an assignment or project, everything is exactly where it should be. Declutter your workspace so you don't have to waste time searching for what you need.</p>
                
                <h2>Take Notes</h2>
                <p>If you have trouble remembering details, keep a Google doc or notepad open for notes. Cheatsheets are handy too, but when you write or type your own notes in your own words, it helps to jog your memory when you look back at it.</p>
